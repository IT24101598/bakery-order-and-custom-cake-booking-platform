 # 2. Add New Cake with Image
  //admin can add cakes and their details to page

      @ Receive Cake Form Data

        Receive Cake object (with name, price, quantity, etc.)
        Receive uploaded image file from form (MultipartFile image)
 
      @ Check if Image Is Uploaded

         If the image is NOT empty:
          - Continue to upload image
         Else:
          - Skip image upload
   
      @ Clean and Prepare the Image Filename(AI support)

         originalFileName = image.getOriginalFilename()
         cleanFileName = removePathAndSpecialChars(originalFileName)
        
          public class Constant {
    
          public static final String IMAGE_DIR = "src/main/resources/static/images/";

          }
      
      @ Ensure images

         uploadPath = Path to IMAGE_DIR (e.g., /uploads/images)
         the upload folder doesn't exist:

          - Create the directory

             // ensures that your server has a folder ready to store uploaded image(Ai-supported)
              Path uploadPath = Paths.get(IMAGE_DIR);

               Files.createDirectories(uploadPath);
               }
     @  Rename Image with Cake ID Prefix

       newFileName = cake.id + "_" + cleanFileName
       filePath = uploadPath + newFileName
       Purpose: Ensure filename is unique and traceable to the cake.

    @  Copy the Uploaded File to the Upload Folder

    Files.copy(image.getInputStream(), filePath, REPLACE_IF_EXISTS)
     Purpose: Save the uploaded image physically on the server.

    @ Set Image Path to the Cake Object

    cake.setImagePath("/images/" + newFileName)

    @ Save Cake to Database via CakeService

    cakeService.addCake(cake) #
